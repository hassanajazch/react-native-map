#### Code Style
- Perfectly follow Single Responsibility rule
- Build Separate components based on responsibility
- Use `ESLint` to follow specific standards
- Add `prettier` to keep code ident
- Use TRY - Catch to never miss any error

#### Testing (Needs to be implemented)
- I have used `JEST` for testing
- Use AAA pattern for writing unit test (Arrange, Act, Assert)
